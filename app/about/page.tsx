        <strong>onestupidquiz</strong> is a satirical take on society’s obsession
        with assessments, scores, and the idea that every question always has
        “the one correct answer.”

        This project is built for entertainment and fun. It’s not about winning
        or losing — it’s about laughing at the absurdity of how everything gets
        measured and graded.

        answer is taking it too seriously. 😉
